Welcome to the `abTEM` gallery. These notebooks demonstrate specific a many of the concepts learned in the

* {bdg-success}`basic` Examples that cover the basics image simulation, these examples are generally appropriate for new
  users. Many of these examples may also be used as a template for performing a specific common type of simulation.
* {bdg-danger}`specialized` Examples that introduce a less common  Most of these examples assume that the user have
  experience with image simulation and abTEM, specifically.
* {bdg-primary}`publication` Examples that replicate published results, either fully or partially.
