__*ab*TEM: transmission electron microscopy from first principles__

*ab*TEM is a flexible open-source package for simulating transmission electron microscopy experiments. The Python API
allows for easy integration with other simulation codes and analysis tools accessible from Python, while utilization of
other open-source projects makes *abTEM* fast and scalable.

Here are a few links to help you get started.
