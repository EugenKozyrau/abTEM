# ## Dask
# 
# *abTEM* is parallelized using [Dask](https://dask.org/) {cite}`dask`. 
# 
# Parallel computation in abTEM whether it is running on a laptop or a High Performance Computing cluster is parallelized through . 
# 
# Some knowledge of Dask may be required to run abTEM effectively on large multi-CPU/GPU systems, however, if you are just running abTEM on your own computer, this tutorial gets you started. If you want a quick introduction to Dask, we recommend thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnndxbr_Xq4&t=66s) short youtube video.
