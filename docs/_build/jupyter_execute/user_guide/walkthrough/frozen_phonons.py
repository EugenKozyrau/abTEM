# # Frozen phonons
# 
# The atoms in real materials are not stationary, they vibrate around their position in the crystal due to thermal and zero-point vibrations. 
# 
# Vibrational scattering scattering (or electron-phonon scattering) is responsible for features including diffuse backgrounds and Kikuchi lines as well as for a large part of the high-angle scattering measured in annular dark-field measurements.
# 
# The frozen phonon approximation is a simple, if somewhat brute, approach to numerically simulate the effects of thermal vibrations. In the Frozen phonon approximation, the intensity is averaged over several frozen snapshots of the atomic model as it vibrates. Hence, each frozen phonon captures the atomic model with its atoms displaced by a different random offset.
# 
# ## Kikuchi lines in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> 
# We simulate SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(100) with frozen phonons. In order to observe visible Kikuchi lines, the sample needs some thickness, hence the unit cell is repeated 80 times along the $z$-direction. We also need too repeat the atoms in $x$ and $y$, otherwise the structure is just a repetition of the same unit with displaced atoms.

# The `FrozenPhonons` displaces the atoms according to a Gaussian distribution (equivalent to the Einstein model of the density of states for phonons) using a random number generator with a given seed. 
# 
# The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution may be provided as a single number for all atoms, for each element as a dictionary or for each atom as an array.
# 
# Below we create an ensemble of $12$ random atomic models, with a standard deviation of atomic displacements of $0.1 \ \mathrm{Ã…}$ and a seed of $100$.

# Below the fully elastic and phonon models are compared for two MAADF signals ($[50, 100] \ \mathrm{mrad}$ and $[50, 120] \ \mathrm{mrad}$) and HAADF signal ($[50, 200] \ \mathrm{mrad}$).
# 
# Both cases clearly demonstrates the importance of phonon scattering. The scattering in the phonon model is generally stronger, especially the background, however, on a strongly scattering column the elastic model may scatter slightly more strongly, as seen in the HAADF signal.
# 
# Comparing the two elastic MAADF signals we see how sensitive this model is to the inclusion of the first Laue diffraction ring, at $~110 \ \mathrm{mrad}$, in the integration range.
