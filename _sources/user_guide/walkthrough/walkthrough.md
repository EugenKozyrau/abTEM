# Walkthrough

The abTEM walkthrough is an in-depth introduction to the abTEM features from examples. The walkthrough is created to
be read sequentially. We also hope that the walkthrough will teach beginners how to do basic image simulation.

To navigate the walkthrough, click on the links in the side navigation tree, or find the link to the next page at the
bottom-right of each page.

This documentation is built using Jupyter book, this means that [source code]() for many of the documentation pages,
including all the pages in the walkthrough, are *Jupyter* notebooks. You can download these notebooks and run them
yourself if you wish, however, note that some elements may not be rendered as nicely as the online version. We hide some
code cells to improve the readability, for example, we hide all top import statements.
