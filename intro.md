`abTEM` - ab initio Transmission Electron Microscopy in Python

abTEM is a fast flexible code for running simulations of Transmission Electron Microscopy images. It is written entirely
in Python, which enables easy integration with first-principles codes and analysis tools accessible from Python, and
allows for a simple and intuitive user interface. The computationally demanding parts are implemented using jit-compiled
Numba code and high-performance libraries, maintaining speed while ensuring portability.

abTEM works with the Atomic Simulation Environment and the density functional theory code GPAW to provide an seamless
environment for simulating images from first principles.
